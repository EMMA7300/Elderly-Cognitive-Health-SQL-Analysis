# Elderly Cognitive Health Assessment: SQL-Based Population Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 1,200 elderly patients (ages 60-89) to identify risk factors for cognitive decline using SQL database queries and healthcare analytics. Built a complete SQL database from raw data, developed 5 complex analytical queries examining demographics, chronic disease burden, education impact, and lifestyle factors, then delivered insights through Excel dashboards with executive summaries. The analysis revealed that 42% of elderly have poor sleep regardless of activity level, the 70-79 age group shows peak depression requiring targeted intervention, and surprisingly, patients with 1-2 managed chronic conditions demonstrated better cognitive health than those with zero conditions—suggesting healthcare engagement itself is protective.

## Key Findings & Business Impact
- **Identified high-risk populations**: 70-79 age group needs immediate mental health screening (GDS: 5.36, highest depression)
- **Quantified education's protective effect**: +0.79 MMSE points for higher education, informing targeted cognitive programs for low-education elderly
- **Discovered sleep crisis**: 508 patients (42%) have poor sleep—universal intervention priority across all demographics
- **Challenged assumptions**: Moderate physical activity with poor sleep showed best cognitive outcomes (MMSE: 22.28), revealing complex lifestyle interactions
- **Resource allocation insight**: 53% of elderly have 1-2 chronic conditions and show optimal cognitive health, proving healthcare engagement matters more than disease absence

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
**SQL**: Complex CASE statements, GROUP BY aggregations (AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX), cross-tabulation, population segmentation | **Python**: Pandas data manipulation, SQLite3 database creation, data quality assessment | **Excel**: Multi-sheet workbooks, professional formatting, executive summaries | **Healthcare Analytics**: MMSE/GDS clinical interpretation, geriatric population health, evidence-based recommendations

**Tools**: Python, SQL (SQLite), Excel, Jupyter Notebook  
**Files**: SQL database, 7-sheet Excel report, complete query documentation, reproducible Jupyter analysis
